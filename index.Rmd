# LANDFIRE and the Forest Stewardship Council US Standards
Principles 6 and 9 of the Forest Stewardship Council have many criteria that require an understanding of ecosystem distributions past and present, historical disturbance regimes and succession classes of each ecosystem, past and present.  The nation's [LANDFIRE](www.landfire.gov) program produces many spatial datasets and ecological models that are relevant to these criteria.  Here we will provide technical guidance to develop charts, tables and maps that will get at:

* historical ecosystem locations and amounts, and conversion to other land uses (e.g., agriculture) and ecosystems (e.g., northern pine-oak historically, northern hardwoods currently)
* historical disturbance regimes
* succession classes of each ecosystems, past and present

**ALSO analysis that will help with HCVAs and RSAs**
