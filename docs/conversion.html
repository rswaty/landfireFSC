<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Second question: how much of the historic ecosystems have been converted to a different land use (e.g., agriculture), or have succeeded to a different ecosystem?</h2>
<p>If you are new to Pivot Tables this next section will 1) demonstrate their power and 2) showcase ways they can mislead!</p>
<p>Working in the Pivot Table from before (or you can create a new one if you prefer):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check the box next to “EVT_NAME” in the Pivot Table Fields pane. Make sure that everything is arranged as in the screenshot below (e.g., “BPS_NAME” is on top of “EVT_NAME” in the “Rows” pane). Note-I am about to sort in descending order.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="pivotBpsEvt.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Review the results. In the example above we can see that what LANDFIRE mapped as Laurentian-Acadian Forest-Hemlock in the BpS data set has been split into many Existing Vegetation Types. If ordered we get a little more information, but the numbers are misleading. We’d like to see how much of what was Ecosystem X is still Ecosystem X, and how much is now Ecosystem Y, and so on, but the numbers are looking across the whole landscape. They need to be recalculated so we get the percentage of EVT per BpS.</li>
<li>To reconfigure the Pivot Table:
<ul>
<li>Drag the “Sum of ACRES2” and “Sum of ACRES3” field from the “Values” pane up to the Pivot Table Fields to remove it.</li>
<li>Click the “Sum of ACRES” item in the “Values” pane to access the Value field settings.</li>
<li>Click on the “Show Values As” tab, then select “% of Parent Row Total” in the “Show Values As” drop down.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of making that selection:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="pivotPercentParent.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You’ll see that ~34% of what was classified as “Boreal Acidic Peatland Systems” in the BpS dataset for our landscape is now classified as “Boreal-Laurentian Conifer Acidic Swamp and Treed Poor Fen” in the Existing Vegetation Type dataset. Scroll through the table below to explore the resulting data. The table has been exported from the Pivot Table and cleaned up a bit for viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Note: I filtered for the Top 10 EVTs per BpS.</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest - Hemlock for our landscape we note a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of what was mapped as this type historically in the BpS dataset is still mapped as that type</li>
<li>Cumulatively about 6% of this type is now roads and recently logged types.</li>
<li>The other EVTs mapped are not terribly “off-site” (e.g., something like “Plantation”).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-fine-print" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> The fine print</h2>
<p>While this assessment is illustrative, it is important to note that the methods used to create the BpS and EVT datasets are substantially different, and LANDFIRE datasets are not made for assessing small areas. Please review.</p>
</div>
<div id="visual-exploration" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Visual exploration</h2>
<p>Sometimes patterns emerge from visuals. Below is a Sankey chart generated in R. On the left are the historical ecosystems, on the right current ecosystems. If you hover over the colored bands you can explore what the historical ecosystems are today, or where current ecosystems came from. Some potential interpretations, partially based on the chart, partially based on local knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is more northern hardwoods mapped today than historically. This could be due to “simplification” of ecosystems that have some shared species. For example, many conifers have been removed and deer present a challenge for regeneration. One hypothesis would be that due to logging and deer the “Pine-Hemlock-Hardwood-Forest” has been essentially converted to “Northern Hardwoods”.</li>
<li>It might be more illuminating to group some types together, such as the “Recently Logged” types.</li>
<li>LANDFIRE has mapped potential change of the wetlands to other types. This could be due to mapping errors, or due to alterations in hydrology because of roads perhaps. More investigation is warrented.</li>
