**The Ataya Forest Tract**

Our example landscape is TNC's "Ataya" tract, an approximately 100,688-acre forested landscape in southeastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee. The Ataya is located in the Central Appalachians, and is situated in the historic homelands of the S'atsoyaha (Yuchi), Shawandasse Tula (Shawnee), and the Tsalaguwetiyi (Cherokee, East) nations. The nearest largest metropolitan area to Ataya is Knoxville, TN (population 186,173). According to LANDFIRE's Biophysical Settings (BpS), the historically dominant forest ecosystem types consisted of Southern Appalachian Oak Forest, South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forest, and Southern Appalachian Cove Forest. Historically in Southern Appalachian Oak Forests, low severity surface fires with fire intervals of 7-26 years were a dominant ecosystem disturbance. Other important disturbances in the forests of the Ataya include insect outbreaks, ice storms, windthrow, and drought. 

The forests in the Central Appalachians experienced considerable alteration with European colonization and land use changes. Important land use and ecological changes included extensive clear-cut logging in the early 20th century, coal mining, the functional extinction of the American Chestnut (**Castanea dentata**) and fire-suppression policies enacted in the early 20th century. Currently, the Central Appalachians are facing population reductions in fire tolerant/shade intolerant species such as oaks and shortleaf pine (**Pinus echinata**), drastic declines of eastern hemlock (**Tsuga canadensis**) with the introduction of Hemlock Wooly Adgelgid, and various invasive plant (i.e. kudzu, autumn olive, Japanese stilt grass) threats.  

The Ataya is of conservation interest due to the relatively high connectivity, large average land parcel size and projected climate change resiliency.
