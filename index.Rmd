# LANDFIRE and the Forest Stewardship Council US Standards



## LANDFIRE and FSC Principle 6: General Potential

Principle 6 of the US Forest Stewardship Council standards (both current and draft) centers on Environmental Values and Impacts.  There are several assessment criteria, with some focusing on documenting historical ecosystem attributes then comparing them to current.  These criteria are where [LANDFIRE](www.landfire.gov) products best fit.  

Below we'll explore use of LANDFIRE products for specific indicators, with the DRAFT standards as the focus.

## General

* list LANDFIRE datasets to obtain
* scale issue warning




## Criteria 6.1, Assessing Environmental Values and Impacts

From the standards document (currently page 35 in draft):

<div class = "blue">
The Organization shall assess environmental values in the Management Unit and
FSCÂ® NATIONAL FOREST STEWARDSHIP STANDARD OF THE UNITED STATES (V2-0 D1-0) 36
those values outside the Management Unit potentially affected by management
activities. This assessment shall be undertaken with a level of detail, scale, and
frequency that is proportionate to the scale, intensity, and risk of management
activities, and is sufficient for the purpose of deciding the necessary conservation
measures, and for detecting and monitoring possible negative impacts of those
activities.

### Indicator 6.1.1-assessment of conditions
This indicator seems to speak directly to LANDFIRE, as the suite of products can be used pretty directly to get at:

* forest community types
* succession classes
* natural disturbance regimes
* historical conditions (community types and succession classes)
* comparing historical to current conditions
