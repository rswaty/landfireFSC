It was written in R using R-Studio, the bookdown package and is hosted on GitHub. The goals are to: get acres of ecosystems past and present explore ecosystem conversion compare amounts of succession classes past and present calculate annual acres burned In the United States, including the insular areas LANDFIRE provides the datasets and ecological model results to get at these challenges and more. Here we walk you through some of the technical steps needed to start your analysis. We will do our work in a model landscape, the Michigamme Highlands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (highlighted in green in map below). To help you with the concepts we work through pre-processed LANDFIRE data for an example landscape. To prepare the datasets for your landscape see the Appendix. 1.1 Download this!
