## Export combine_studyArea attribute table into an Excel Workbook

**Turn your GIS attribute table into an excel workbook and create your own pivot tables**

1. Locate the "Table to Table" tool in a geoprocessing search
2. In inputs rows, select "combine_studyArea"
3. For the output location, save it to your project database
4. For output name, type "Ataya_combineClean" (or your preferred name)

```{r GIS19, echo=FALSE, out.width=100}
knitr::include_graphics("04_gis_screenshots/19_table_table.png")

```

5. Run the tool. Once complete locate "Table to Excel"
6. For the Input Table, select the table we just created in our project database.
7. Navigate to an output folder location of your choosing. *Make sure to type ".xlsx" at the end of the file pathway. This will ensure your excel file is in the latest excel workbook format.*

```{r GIS20, echo=FALSE, out.width=100}
knitr::include_graphics("04_gis_screenshots/20_Table_Excel.png")

```

8. Click "Run" and open your table!
9. You can now clean up the data table by getting rid of unnessecary columns (OID, VALUE, BPS CODE, etc.)
10. To create pivot tables, select all columns and go to Insert -> Pivot Table -> New worksheet. 
11. Repeat step 10 for all the pivot table analyses you need.
