If you are new to Pivot Tables this next section will 1) demonstrate their power and 2) showcase ways they can mislead! Working in the Pivot Table from before (or you can create a new one if you prefer): Check the box next to EVT_NAME in the Pivot Table Fields pane. Make sure that everything is arranged as in the screenshot below (e.g., BPS_NAME is on top of EVT_NAME in the Rows pane). Note-I am about to sort in descending order. Review the results. In the example above we can see that what LANDFIRE mapped as Laurentian-Acadian Forest-Hemlock in the BpS data set has been split into many Existing Vegetation Types. If ordered we get a little more information, but the numbers are misleading. Wed like to see how much of what was Ecosystem X is still Ecosystem X, and how much is now Ecosystem Y, and so on, but the numbers are looking across the whole landscape. They need to be recalculated so we get the percentage of EVT per BpS. To reconfigure the Pivot Table: Drag the Sum of ACRES2 and Sum of ACRES3 field from the Values pane up to the Pivot Table Fields to remove it. Click the Sum of ACRES item in the Values pane to access the Value field settings. Click on the Show Values As tab, then select % of Parent Row Total in the Show Values As drop down. Heres a screenshot of making that selection: Youll see that ~34% of what was classified as Boreal Acidic Peatland Systems in the BpS dataset for our landscape is now classified as Boreal-Laurentian Conifer Acidic Swamp and Treed Poor Fen in the Existing Vegetation Type dataset. Scroll through the table below to explore the resulting data. The table has been exported from the Pivot Table and cleaned up a bit for viewing. Note: I filtered for the Top 10 EVTs per BpS. Looking at the Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest - Hemlock for our landscape we note a few things: Most of what was mapped as this type historically in the BpS dataset is still mapped as that type Cumulatively about 6% of this type is now roads and recently logged types. The other EVTs mapped are not terribly off-site (e.g., something like Plantation). 5.2 The fine print While this assessment is illustrative, it is important to note that the methods used to create the BpS and EVT datasets are substantially different, and LANDFIRE datasets are not made for assessing small areas. Please review. 5.3 Visual exploration "]]
