It was written in R using R-Studio, the bookdown package and is hosted on GitHub. The goals are to: get acres of ecosystems past and present explore ecosystem conversion compare amounts of succession classes past and present calculate annual acres burned In the United States, including the insular areas LANDFIRE provides the datasets and ecological model results to get at these challenges and more. Here we walk you through some of the technical steps needed to start your analysis. We will do our work in a model landscape, the Michigamme Highlands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (highlighted in green in map). To help you with the concepts we work through pre-processed LANDFIRE data for an example landscape. To prepare the datasets for your landscape see the Appendix. 1.1 Getting Started For this guide we have done some of the heavy lifting for you, i.e., the GIS work and creation of an Excel workbook [INSERT LINK HERE]. You can explore the GIS work we did, and the datasets at [INSERT LINK TO ARCMAP PROJECT HERE] "],["exampleIntro.html", "2 Our example landscape", " 2 Our example landscape The Michigamme Highlands Our example landscape is in the north central region of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (a mouthful, eh?). The largest nearby city is Marquette, MI, population 20,822 (2019). This ecoregion is ~757,000 acres (306380 hectares) and is know for its beautiful forests, rivers and lakes. It is underlain by sandstone, slate, shale and iron formations. Elevations range from around 600ft to almost 2,000 ft above sea level. The ecoregion has a humid continental climate with a growing season ranging from 75-150 days and average snowfall amounts reaching 200 inches in the higher terrain. Logging and mining have been the major industrial forces in the area. Both continue today, especially logging. Mining has transitioned from largely iron to primarily nickel. The area is of of conservation interest due to the relativiliy high connectivity, large avereage land parcel size and projected climate change resiliency (see map below).

This dataset will be used to get at community habitat, or where ecosystems could occur based on abiotic factors (e.g., soils, climate). Succession classes characterizes structural classes on the landscape at the time the dataset represents (e.g., 2016 for LF Version 200). Existing Vegetation Type maps NatureServes Ecological Systems (see descriptions here). Non-spatial products Biophysical Settings Descriptions which has information on natural disturbance regimes and succession class descriptions (also available here). Reference Condition Table supplements the BpS descriptions with the reference percentages for each succession class, for each Biophysical Settings. 3.3 Guidance on obtaining LANDFIRE products There are multiple ways to get LANDFIRE depending on whether you are looking to obtain BpS models and descriptions or the spatial data: For BpS models and descriptions go to: http://landfirereview.org/search.php. Start by clicking on the View map of LANDFIRE Map Zones. This will help you narrow down your search. Alternatively, you can wait to download BpS descriptions until you do some GIS work and get specific names of BpSs of interest. For the spatial datasets you can explore options here which include: Downloading Full Extent Mosaics. When you do use this option you get large files that cover the entire lower 48, AK or HI (depending on your selection). We use this method when we have several landscapes and/or a large area and no computer storage issues. Using the LANDFIRE Data Distribution Site. With this method you essentially select the datasets you need then draw a rectangle (or you can select state or counties) around your area of interest to start the downloader. We recommend this if your area of interest is not too large and/or you have a low number of landscapes and/or have storage limits. "],["historicalEcosystems.html", "4 Historical Ecosystems 4.1 General methods 4.2 Getting at amounts of historical ecosystems", " 4 Historical Ecosystems In this chapter we will learn which ecosystems, and how much of each were on our landscape historically. 4.1 General methods In this section (and most others) we will depend on Pivot Tables in Excel. They are powerful (for better or worse!) tools that allow for tasks such as: organization and formatting of data calculations filtering data nesting data With the power comes the call for caution. It is super easy to display values that look illuminating-but may be wrong. You can easily be duped into complacency, especially when working in the value field settings. 4.2 Getting at amounts of historical ecosystems Start by opening the historical tab in the Excel workbook. In the Pivot Table Fields pane, select BPS_NAME then ACRES. Right click in the top cell of the Sum of ACRES column (not the column header) in the Pivot Table, then Sort Largest to Smallest. In our example we have some BpSs that have low ACRES values. We also have categories that are not meaningful, such as Barren-Rock/Sand/Clay. We can do a little formatting/cleaning before making a chart: To remove BpSs from the table you will click the drop-down menu to the right of BPS_NAME in the Pivot Table Fields pane. You can uncheck BpSs as appropriate. It is also possible to filter by right clicking on the top value in the list of BpSs, then selecting Filter &gt; Top 10. Once in that menu you can refine the filtering. To get percentages, drag ACRES from the top Pivot Table Field pane to the Values pane. This will add a second ACRES column to the table. Click the drop down in the second instance of ACRES (reads SUM of ACRES2 in our example), then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the Show Values As tab, click the Show Values As drop down then select % of Grand Total% to get percentages of each BpS (make sure thatBPS_NAME\" is selected as the Base field). To get a running total of percentages you will add a third instance of ACRES to the Values pane, then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the Show Values As tab, click the Show Values As drop down then select % Running Total In to get running totals of percentages of each BpS (make sure that BPS_NAME is selected as the Base field). Save! Formatted table of BpSs: We see that the top 4 BpSs comprised ~80% of our example landscape historically. We can visually confirm this and other patterns with a quick chart made in R (similar charts available in Excel by highlighting the data, clicking Insert then selecting the chart type in the Charts tab): "],["evt.html", "5 Existing Vegetation Types 5.1 General methods 5.2 Getting at amounts of current ecosystems", " 5 Existing Vegetation Types While looking at the historical ecosystems gives context, we also need to get a picture of which ecosystems are on the landscape today. 5.1 General methods We use the same general methods as we did on the Historical Ecosystems page, using a Pivot Table. We rely on LANDFIREs Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) data for this assessment. 5.2 Getting at amounts of current ecosystems Start by opening the current tab in the Excel workbook. In the Pivot Table Fields pane, select EVT_NAME then ACRES. Make sure that EVT_NAME is in the Rows pane, and that Sum of ACRES is in the Values pane. Right click in the top cell of the Sum of ACRES column (not the column header) in the Pivot Table, then Sort Largest to Smallest. In our example we have some BpSs that have low ACRES values. We also have categories that are not meaningful, such as Barren-Rock/Sand/Clay. We can do a little formatting/cleaning before making a chart: To remove EVTs from the table you will click the drop-down menu to the right of BPS_NAME in the Pivot Table Fields pane. You can uncheck BpSs as appropriate. It is also possible to filter by right clicking on the top value in the list of EVTs within the Pivot Table, then selecting Filter &gt; Top 10. Once in that menu you can refine the filtering. Additionally we like to add commas and remove decimal places. To do this right click the row that contains Sum of ACRES in the spreadsheet (likely row B), select Format Cells &gt; Number &gt; set Decimal places to 0 then check the \"Use 1000 Separator box. To get percentages, drag ACRES from the top Pivot Table Field pane to the Values pane. This will add a second ACRES column to the table. Click the drop down in the second instance of ACRES (reads SUM of ACRES2 in our example), then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the Show Values As tab, click the Show Values As drop down then select % of Grand Total% to get percentages of each BpS (make sure thatBPS_NAME\" is selected as the Base field). To get a running total of percentages you will add a third instance of ACRES to the Values pane, then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the Show Values As tab, click the Show Values As drop down then select % Running Total In to get running totals of percentages of each BpS (make sure that BPS_NAME is selected as the Base field). Save! Formatted table of EVTs: We see that first there are many EVTs. This partially due to the addition of Developed and other modern categories such as Recently Logged-Tree Cover. Second we see that of the natural types their is a close match with the historical. We can visually confirm this and other patterns with a quick chart made in R (similar charts available in Excel by highlighting the data, clicking Insert then selecting the chart type in the Charts tab): "],["conversion.html", "6 Exploring conversion 6.1 Second question: how much of the historic ecosystems have been converted to a different land use (e.g., agriculture), or have succeeded to a different ecosystem? 6.2 The fine print 6.3 Visual exploration", " 6 Exploring conversion How much have historical ecosystems been converted to other land uses, or succeeded to other ecosystem types. 6.1 Second question: how much of the historic ecosystems have been converted to a different land use (e.g., agriculture), or have succeeded to a different ecosystem? If you are new to Pivot Tables this next section will 1) demonstrate their power and 2) showcase ways they can mislead! Working in the Pivot Table from before (or you can create a new one if you prefer): Check the box next to EVT_NAME in the Pivot Table Fields pane. Make sure that everything is arranged as in the screenshot below (e.g., BPS_NAME is on top of EVT_NAME in the Rows pane). Note-I am about to sort in descending order. Review the results. In the example above we can see that what LANDFIRE mapped as Laurentian-Acadian Forest-Hemlock in the BpS data set has been split into many Existing Vegetation Types. If ordered we get a little more information, but the numbers are misleading. Wed like to see how much of what was Ecosystem X is still Ecosystem X, and how much is now Ecosystem Y, and so on, but the numbers are looking across the whole landscape. They need to be recalculated so we get the percentage of EVT per BpS. To reconfigure the Pivot Table: Drag the Sum of ACRES2 and Sum of ACRES3 field from the Values pane up to the Pivot Table Fields to remove it. Click the Sum of ACRES item in the Values pane to access the Value field settings. Click on the Show Values As tab, then select % of Parent Row Total in the Show Values As drop down. Heres a screenshot of making that selection: Youll see that ~34% of what was classified as Boreal Acidic Peatland Systems in the BpS dataset for our landscape is now classified as Boreal-Laurentian Conifer Acidic Swamp and Treed Poor Fen in the Existing Vegetation Type dataset. Scroll through the table below to explore the resulting data. The table has been exported from the Pivot Table and cleaned up a bit for viewing. Note: I filtered for the Top 10 EVTs per BpS. Looking at the Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest - Hemlock for our landscape we note a few things: Most of what was mapped as this type historically in the BpS dataset is still mapped as that type Cumulatively about 6% of this type is now roads and recently logged types. The other EVTs mapped are not terribly off-site (e.g., something like Plantation). 6.2 The fine print While this assessment is illustrative, it is important to note that the methods used to create the BpS and EVT datasets are substantially different, and LANDFIRE datasets are not made for assessing small areas. Please review. 6.3 Visual exploration Sometimes patterns emerge from visuals. Below is a Sankey chart generated in R. On the left are the historical ecosystems, on the right current ecosystems. If you hover over the colored bands you can explore what the historical ecosystems are today, or where current ecosystems came from. Some potential interpretations, partially based on the chart, partially based on local knowledge: There is more northern hardwoods mapped today than historically. This could be due to simplification of ecosystems that have some shared species. For example, many conifers have been removed and deer present a challenge for regeneration. One hypothesis would be that due to logging and deer the Pine-Hemlock-Hardwood-Forest has been essentially converted to Northern Hardwoods. It might be more illuminating to group some types together, such as the Recently Logged types. LANDFIRE has mapped potential change of the wetlands to other types. This could be due to mapping errors, or due to alterations in hydrology because of roads perhaps. More investigation is warrented. "],["successionClasses.html", "7 Succession Classes 7.1 What we will do here 7.2 What are Succession Classes? 7.3 Our sample ecosystem 7.4 Your tasks", " 7 Succession Classes 7.1 What we will do here While looking at conversion of historical ecosystems is valuable, we can dig deeper, comparing amounts historical succession classes to current. This gives us a broad measure of vegetation structure for ecosystems. 7.2 What are Succession Classes? In general LANDFIRE succession classes are stages of development defined in the descriptions of each Biophysical Setting. They are characterized by height, canopy cover and to some degree species composition. Key takeaways: To learn what the succession classes are for each Biophysical Setting you look to the corresponding description on http://landfirereview.org/test/search.php LANDFIRE used state and transition models to estimate the amount of each succession class that would occur with natural (pre-European colonization) disturbance regimes. Historical succession classes were not mapped as they were assumed to move around over time. The Succession Class dataset maps current succession classes, in addition to agricultural and developed land-use classes plus uncharacteristic vegetation. By comparing the amounts of historical and current succession classes you can get a sense of which classes are over/under represented. 7.3 Our sample ecosystem To illustrate the concept of comparing reference to current succession classes we will focus on the Northern Hardwoods-Hemlock Biophysical Setting. It is a dominant ecosystem in the Michigamme Highlands, has been heavily managed and faces many threats such as deer browsing. 7.4 Your tasks We will start with our friend the Pivot Table to get current percentages of the relevant succession classes, then will look to the Biophysical Settings descriptions to get historical percentages. 7.4.1 Current succession classes Open the successionClasses worksheet in our combineClean.xlsx workbook. In the Pivot Table Fields box highlight BPS_MODEL -&gt; click the down arrow -&gt; select only Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest - Hemlock. Check the box next to BPS_NAME. In the Pivot Table Fields check the box next to LABEL to get a list of current succession classes. In the Pivot Table Fields check the box next to ACRES. In the Values pane click the doww arrow -&gt; select Value Field Settings. Once the Value field settings are open click Show Values As -&gt; select % of Grand Total from the dropdown list. Copy the resultant table -&gt; paste next to the Pivot Table in the same worksheet -&gt; add column names Succession class and Current. 7.4.2 Historical succession classes Go to http://landfirereview.org/test/search.php, search for Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest - Hemlock and download the corresponding document. It will be Model Number 13022, Map Zone(s) 41, 50, 51. Skim through the document to get a sense of the ecosystem, paying particular attention to the Succession Classes section. There will be 5 succession classes, A, B, C, D and E with corresponding estimated reference amounts. For example, Succession Class A was modeled to be rare in this ecosystem that did not have much fire. We estimated that only 1% of this ecosystem would have been Succession Class a historically. Back in the pivot table name you will create a new column named Historical then type the succession class percentages from the document into the corresponding row. Now we can start to see some patterns emerge. We wont spoil your fun by saying what those patterns are!

"],["gisPrep.html", "9 APPENDIX 9.1 GIS Prep: Combine data 9.2 GIS Prep: Join in attributes 9.3 GIS Prep:Clean data table", " 9 APPENDIX 9.1 GIS Prep: Combine data Once spatial data is properly projected and clipped to area of interest, perform a combine in ArcMap (Toolbox &gt; Spatial Analyst &gt; Local &gt; Combine) of the BpS, SCL and EVT datasets. Alternatively, you can combine a raster of the area of interest with those 3 datasets which are stored as larger extents (like shown below). 9.2 GIS Prep: Join in attributes There are multiple ways-we recommend using the Join Field tool (Toolbox &gt; data management tools &gt; joins &gt; add join). One reason to do this is to be able to select which fields to join in. A potential resulting table looks like this for a landscape in Michigan (with minimal cleaning/formatting): As is this table does not mean too much-we will need to do some cleaning, formatting and calculating. 9.3 GIS Prep:Clean data table You will first need to save the combined .csv file file as an .xlsx file so that you can have multiple worksheets. We recommend keeping the original output as a raw spreadsheet in Excel, pasting that data into a new sheet and working with that new sheet moving forward. * It is OK to remove the US_200BPS, US_200EVT, and US_200SCLASS columns * Rename some columns: GROUPVEG to BPSGROUPVEG; EVT_PHYS to EVTGROUPVEG; LABEL to SUCCESSIONCLASS, or similar as needed for clarity * COUNT = number of 30m x 30m pixels for that combination of BpS-EVT-SCLS. Insert a column named ACRES, then calculate acres by multiplying COUNT by 0.222. Copy-Paste Values for that new column. Below is an example of what our new data table looks like. "]]
